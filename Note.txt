 Javascript
------------
- JS can be used in both front-end as well as back-end
- to provide behaviour - front-end
- to do logical operations- back-end
- is a single thread programming language - line by line execution
- dynamically typed language - dataType can be changed

js is compiled using node.
extention: .js

display content - console.log();

DATA TYPES - total no.of data-type 8 
----------
1) string - single / double quotes
2) boolean - true or false
3) number - integer/decimal

method to check data-type - typeOf()

concatenation - to join/add same or different dataType
-------------
string + string = string
string + number = string
number + number = number

Variables
---------
-used to store data
-to create variables - identifiers -
     set of rules to create variables.
   rules: 1) start with letter, $, _ :prefer letter
          2) subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscore
          3) if there is more than 1 word : 
               - 2nd word can be started with capital letter
               - use underscore between the words
               - no space between the words

   variableName = value;

   keyword variableName = value;

   keyword - set of reserved words which gives a special meaning to variables.
           - cannot be used as variable-name , fn name etc.
     1) const - value doesn't change - re-assigning is not possible
                    - hoisting is not possible
     2) var - value changes throughout - re-assigning is possible
                    - hoisting is possible
     3) let - re-assigning is possible
            - block level access
            - hoisting is not possible

- hoisting : using variables before it is declared/created

template literals
-----------------
- it's a way of displaying content.
  `content ${variables}`
